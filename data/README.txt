CO2 - TEMPERATURE MAPPING

Mapping of
    x: cumulative CO2 emissions in GtC (Carbon Gigatonnes, including sequestration) from 2010 to 2100 
    y: global mean temperature rise relative to 1986-2005 mean in K.

TEMPERATURE - SEA LEVEL MAPPING

PARAMETERS - CO2 EMISSION MAPPING

Mapping of
    x: policies and behavioral changes
    y: reduction in cumulative CO2 emissions until 2100 off of GCAM reference scenario (in between RCP8.5 and 6.0).

    Based on the cumulative CO2 emissions until 2100 by sector according to the GCAM reference scenario, CO2 emissions of individual sectors or groups are reduced by 80%.
    Reduction of road traffic is made up of 80% reduction in CO2 emissions caused by road freight traffic and 80% reduction of short distance travel (< 10 miles) being responsible for at least 66% of total car emissions according to [3].
